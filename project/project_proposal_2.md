| Project Management Tool | Which software product will you use to plan and track the progress of your project? <br><br> Create a project in the tool you pick. (Popular tools are Trello and Zoho.) <br><br> Using this tool, capture the requirements for your project. Requirements must include critical features including user (also called “behavioral” or “functional”) requirements and non-behavioral (or “non-functional”) requirements. Requirements should be documented as Use Cases according to the templates provided by your instructor. <br><br> The features described in these requirements become your “Product Backlog.” <br><br> Discuss and document a project plan for your project. Project plan includes details such as the number of sprints you require to finish the project and tasks (feature development) planned for each sprint. |
| Plan Cycle within the Project Management Method |Create a three-week sprint in your project management tool. <br><br> Create tasks for the feature development planned in this sprint. <br><br> Discuss with your team and take ownership of the tasks and have due dates assigned for each of these tasks in the sprint.|
| Agile Methodology | Following agile, conduct a ten-minute agile standup meeting where everyone stands in a circle and each team member talks for two minutes about what he/she has been working on, what he/she will work on and are there any challenges he/she is facing. <br><br> Following agile, conduct a sprint retrospective meeting, where the entire team discusses about the happenings of the sprint - what went well, what didn’t go well, what should be improved upon in the next sprint. |
