## Grading Standards

The Moodle course pages is the official site for all notifications, assignments, and all submissions of work for grading (lab assignments, quizzes and exams.)

<!--- Removing Homework for Summer Semester
### Homework Assignments:

The course includes FOUR homework assignments that comprise 20% (200 points) toward your grade. Each assignment must be completed and submitted via Moodle by its due date to earn full credit.
1. Bash Shell Scripts (50 points)
2. Progress tracking tools comparison and Pair programming (25 points)
3. SQL (50 points)
4. REST Weather Map (75 points)
-->

### Quizzes:

Over the course of the 5-week semester, there will be 3 quizzes which together make up 15% of your grade for the course. The quiz questions are based on reading assignments and lectures. The quizzes will be administered and graded by Moodle. A quiz will become unavailable in Moodle at the end of the week it is given. 

### Exams:

During Week 3 and Week 5 there will be Midterm Exams. That is, there will be **TWO** midterm exams. Together the exams make up 20% of your final grade. The exams will be administered and graded by Moodle. An exam will become unavailable in Moodle at the end of the week it is given.

### Group Project:

Students are required to form a team with other students in the same lab section. Each team will execute a software development project. The team will agree upon a software product that they will design, develop and present to the rest of the class during the course of the semester. This project makes up 35% (350 points) toward your grade. The project challenges students to use some of the software tools and development methods covered in lectures/labs. Project grades are based on the submission of the following milestones submitted during the course of the project. 

|             |           |                  |
|:-----------:|:---------:|:----------------:|
| Milestone 1 | 40 Points | Project Proposal |
| Milestone 2 | 35 Points | Agile Client Demo and Write Up of Milestones and Retrospective |
| Milestone 3 | 45 Points | Database Design |
| Milestone 4 | 40 Points | Unit Testing |
| Milestone 5 | 20 Points | Individual Student Meetings |
| Milestone 6 | 40 Points | Project Presentations |
| Milestone 7 | 60 Points | Final Project Report and Product Functionality |

   *Note on Group Project Grade:*
   * Each milestone is submitted for the team as a whole, not as individuals. So every member of the team receives the same score. However, scores are adjusted for each individual’s contribution to the team effort. Your individual score for the group project will depend on your effort and involvement on the project. 
   * Your Grade = (sum of project milestone grades) * peer evaluation * individual participation
   * Peer evaluation is based on your team members’ rating of your contribution. Individual participation is based on the instructor's observation of your Github commits and the instructor's assessment during Milestone 5. 

## Statements on Plagiarism

All students of the University of Colorado at Boulder are responsible for knowing and adhering to the [Academic Integrity Policy](http://www.colorado.edu/policies/academic-integrity-policy) of this institution. Violations of this policy may include: cheating, plagiarism, aid of academic dishonesty, fabrication, lying, bribery, and threatening behavior. All incidents of academic misconduct shall be reported to the Honor Code Council (honor@colorado.edu; 303-735-2273). Students who are found to be in violation of the academic integrity policy will be subject to both academic sanctions from the faculty member and non-academic sanctions (including but not limited to university probation, suspension, or expulsion). Additional information regarding the [Honor Code Policy](http://www.colorado.edu/honorcode/sites/default/files/attached-files/honor_code_policies_and_procedures_2017_0.pdf) can be found online and at the [Honor Code Office](http://www.colorado.edu/honorcode/).

In this class, each student is expected to submit his/her own original work for each assignment, whether it is a lab, quiz, problem set, exam, or other assignment, where the only exceptions to this policy will be noted by the instructor.

Violations of this plagiarism policy, the University Honor Code, and/or the Honor Code pledge shown below will be grounds for one or more of the following: grade reduction, a failing grade, and/or potentially other punitive academic actions, in accordance with the University of Colorado's policy on plagiarism and Honor Code.

### Instructor

Reuse and building upon ideas or code are major parts of modern software development. As a professional programmer you will never write anything from scratch. <!-- This class is structured such that many of the solutions are public. --> You are encouraged to learn from the work of your peers. 

<!--
I won't hunt down people who are simply copying-and-pasting solutions, because without challenging themselves, they are simply wasting their time and money taking this class.
-->

Please respect the terms of use and/or license of any code you find, and if you reimplement or duplicate an algorithm or code from elsewhere, credit the original source with an inline comment.

## Disability

If you qualify for accommodations because of a disability, please submit to your professor a letter from Disability Services in a timely manner (for exam accommodations provide your letter at least one week prior to the exam) so that your needs can be addressed. Disability Services determines accommodations based on documented disabilities. Contact Disability Services at 303-492-8671 or by e-mail at dsinfo@colorado.edu. 

If you have a temporary medical condition or injury, see Temporary Injuries guidelines under the Quick Links at the [Disability Services Website](http://www.colorado.edu/disabilityservices/) and discuss your needs with your professor.

## Religious Observances

Campus policy regarding religious observances requires that faculty make every effort to deal reasonably and fairly with all students who, because of religious obligations, have conflicts with scheduled exams, assignments or required attendance.

In this class, every effort will be made to accommodate all students who, because of religious obligations, have conflicts with scheduled exams, assignments, or other required attendance, provided they notify the professor well in advance of the scheduled conflict. Whenever possible, students should notify faculty at least two weeks in advance of the conflict to request special accommodation. 

See the [Religious Observances Policy](http://www.colorado.edu/policies/observance-religious-holidays-and-absences-classes-andor-exams) for full details.

## Discrimination and Sexual Harassment

The University of Colorado Boulder (CU-Boulder) is committed to maintaining a positive learning, working, and living environment. CU-Boulder will not tolerate acts of discrimination or harassment based upon Protected Classes or related retaliation against or by any employee or student. For purposes of this CU-Boulder policy, "Protected Classes" refers to race, color, national origin, sex, pregnancy, age, disability, creed, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, veteran status, political affiliation or political philosophy. Individuals who believe they have been discriminated against should contact the Office of Institutional Equity and Compliance (OIEC) at 303-492-2127 or the Office of Student Conduct and Conflict Resolution (OSC) at 303-492-5550.
